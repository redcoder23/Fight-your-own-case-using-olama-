However, when Shetty's stay was extended beyond the initial period, he was asked to vacate the premises. Shetty refused, citing the Apartment Rent Control Act, 1960.\n\n**Step 1: Writ Petition**\n\nShetty filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Karnataka High Court, seeking a direction to the IAAI to recognize his tenancy rights and allow him to continue occupying the apartment. He argued that the Apartment Rent Control Act, 1960, applied to the Airport Guest House and that his tenancy rights should be protected.\n\n**Question**\nDo you think it's fair for Shetty to claim protection under the Apartment Rent Control Act, 1960, when he was initially just a guest in the airport guest house?\n\nLet's proceed to the next part of the case.\n\n**Step 2: IAAI's Response**\n\nThe International Airport Authority of India (IAAI) opposed Shetty's petition, arguing that their guest houses were not subject to the Apartment Rent Control Act, 1960. The IAAI claimed that their guest houses were operated under a different set of rules and regulations.\n\n**Question**\nDo you think the IAAI has a valid argument in claiming exemption from the Apartment Rent Control Act, 1960?\n\nLet's move on to the next part of the case.\n\n**Step 3: Court's Ruling**\n\nThe Karnataka High Court ruled that the Apartment Rent Control Act, 1960, indeed applied to the Airport Guest House. The court held that Shetty had acquired a right to tenancy under the act and should not be dispossessed without adequate reason.\n\n**Question**\nDo you think the court made the right decision in applying the Apartment Rent Control Act, 1960, to the airport guest house?\n\nLet's conclude with the summary of the case.\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn **Ramana Dayaram Shetty vs The International Airport Authority of India**, the Karnataka High Court held that the Airport Guest House was subject to the Apartment Rent Control Act, 1960. The court recognized Shetty's tenancy rights and prohibited the IAAI from dispossessing him without adequate reason.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* The court applied the Apartment Rent Control Act, 1960, to the airport guest house.\n* Shetty was granted protection under the act as a tenant.\n* The IAAI was prohibited from dispossessing Shetty without adequate reason.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nThe Karnataka High Court delivered its verdict in favor of Ramana Dayaram Shetty on May 4, 1979.\n\nThat's it! This concludes our interactive reconstruction of the case."
